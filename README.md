# Binary-Conversions

Small console application for converting from decimal or ascii text to binary or from binary to decimal or ascii text.

Compiling the executable:

    -Open the terminal from the location of the directory you copy the program files to.
    -Type the word "make" into the terminal
    -An executable file called binny should be in the directory

Program usage:

Your working directory must be the same as where the executable file is located.

There are four commands to use with this program:
    
    1.  ./binny d (value to convert to binary) 
      
          Ex. ./binny d 12
          Sample output: 1100

          
    2.  ./binny c (ascii text to convert to binary)
    
          Ex.  ./binny c text
          Sample output: 1110100111100011001011110100
          
          
    3.  ./binny bd (binary sequence to convert to decimal value)
    
          Ex.   ./binny bd 1100
          Sample output: 12
          
          
    4.  ./binny bc (binary sequence to convert to ascii text)
    
          Ex.   ./binny bc 1000001
          Sample output: A
